  "Fucking Customers	Today I was asked if I could stay an hour extra since we were short on cashiers. I stayed until 5:00 PM and a little before I was ready to leave this bitch comes in my line. To set the tone this lady was in our store yelling for about two hours in one of the service areas. I was on the Smoke Shop and I am one of the faster cashiers and was finishing up helping this elderly gentlemen make sure he got his bags. This bitch as I'm getting his stuff has the nerve to tell me that I made her miss her public transportation. Um? No you did that yourself by not using time management. She then has the nerve to say well since you made me miss the bus I'll make the line back up and then tells me to double bag all of her stuff which wasn't even worthy of being double bagged. She then roots through her change and says I'll go slow as possible to make your line longer (something to that extent). I finally had enough. I said it's not my fault you missed your bus, I don't make my customers rush to get out of my line, and you should be glad I stayed to even help with cashiering. I am tired of these customers thinking we're doormats and they can walk all over us. She then was like I don't need your dissertation. Well maybe learn what words mean before you say them, because a dissertation is something you write for college LOL! *edited* I was shocked that she came back today and apologized.	ssog4o	574	98	https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/ssog4o/fucking_customers/",

But he showed up arguing that those waters are supposed to be for customers and he even asked me when I said (cuz I‚Äôm an OGP associate) we need water when we‚Äôre outside ‚Äúwell customers do too, and how many times have offered them one?‚Äù He then said that if management sees someone carrying on their pockets or drinking water in the store (doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs in a thermo or a water bottle from the store) they‚Äôll be getting either a write up or coaching. Also, he does not want to see water bottles anywhere in the store. My question is, am I able to take this to open door or some stuff?

I ended up calling one of my friends while doing my jobs (and essentially showing them what I do for a living) until I got stopped by this old guy. The conversation goes as following: Old Guy: Excuse me, (name), are you on break? Me: Nope. Just stocking. Old Guy: You shouldn‚Äôt be talking to anyone while stocking. Me: Alright, sorry about that. I showed him that I hung up and thought that was the end of it, but BOY was I wrong. One of the people working with him pulls me aside and tells me that if old guy catches me on my phone again, he‚Äôs gonna report me. Keep in mind: this guy HATES old guy, so we kinda just laugh it off. The minute I go back to stocking, all my coworkers tell me that Old Guy told everyone he reported me. Not only that, but he followed us around non-stop while pretending to zone. I hit my limit and clocked out early. I already talked to a manager, so I‚Äôm covered. The whole situation kinda pissed me off though, so I just wanted to vent. And for the record: I am aware I shouldn‚Äôt have been on my phone.

  "Just wanted to vent real quick and make sure that I‚Äôm not missing something	I just got done filling the water aisle. This older lady asked me to help her get down two zephyr hills water gallons, because she couldn‚Äôt reach them. I couldn‚Äôt either, so I reached underneath them and used my box cutter to pull them closer to me, that round end of it, so I could grab them. She kinda looked at me hesitantly, and said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no metal in them now, from you using that on them right?‚Äù I was at a loss for words and didn‚Äôt really know what to say, and pretty much said no. She said, ‚Äúbecause they‚Äôre for Guinea pigs, so I need to make sure there‚Äôs no shards or anything in them.‚Äù Still flabbergasted, I kinda stammered, moved the cutter around in like a weird 360¬∞ view, and gave a dumb response, (because I was still so confused) and said, ‚Äúno, it‚Äôs a safety cutter.‚Äù And walked away. I noticed she didn‚Äôt leave the aisle after I left. So I waited a second and then peeked back down the aisle. And lo‚Äô and behold, she was struggling to get down two different ones because she must have believed that I was an evil Guinea pig killer, who magically can put pieces of metal inside a container of water, without making it leak. I wanted so bad to say something to her, but I knew it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Not that I wish harm on anyone, but I was kind of hoping that one might fall down and bonk her on the head, for wasting my time.	sl4dvg	349	49	https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/sl4dvg/just_wanted_to_vent_real_quick_and_make_sure_that/",
